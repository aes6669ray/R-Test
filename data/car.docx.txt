The data was part of the Annual
Meetings (now referred to as the Joint Statistical Meetings) in 
Toronto, August 15-18, 1983. 
Participants were invited to provide 
graphical descriptions of these data.


There are 406 observations (different cars) on the following 8 
variables: 
MPG (miles per gallon), 
# cylinders, 
engine displacement (cu. inches),
horsepower, 
vehicle weight (lbs.), 
time to accelerate from O to 60 mph (sec.), 
model year (modulo 100) between 1970 and 1982 
origin of car (1. American, 2. European, 3. Japanese). 


These data appear on seven pages. Also provided are the
car labels (types) in the same order as the 8 variables on seven
separate pages. Missing data values are marked.
